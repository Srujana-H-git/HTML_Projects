    <p>There are two types of Rockets or launch vehicles they are <br><b>(1) PSLV  <br> (2) GSLV</b> </p>
    <h3>Polar satellite launch vehicles (PSLV) </h3>
    <p><img  align="left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/PSLV_C-35_at_the_launch_pad_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-PSLV_C-35_at_the_launch_pad_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="pslv" width="50" > <br> The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is India's workhorse launch vehicle developed by ISRO. Renowned for its versatility and reliability, PSLV has successfully launched satellites into polar, geostationary, and sun-synchronous orbits. It supports diverse missions, from remote sensing to interplanetary exploration, and played a pivotal role in India's space achievements like Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan. </p>
    
    <h3>Geo-synchronous satellite Launch vehicles (GSLV)</h3>
    <p><img  align="left" src="https://www.orfonline.org/public/uploads/posts/image/GSLV-Mk-III-1.jpg" width="200" alt="Gslv"><br>The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is a key launch vehicle developed by ISRO for deploying heavier payloads into geostationary orbits. Equipped with a powerful cryogenic upper stage, GSLV enables India to launch advanced communication and weather satellites. It supports strategic missions, including Chandrayaan-2, and strengthens India's self-reliance in space technology.</p>
